# common_word_in_villages_names
Welcome to the Punjab Villages Dashboard Project! In this repository, I'm compiling a comprehensive list of over 5300 Punjab villages' names stored in an Excel sheet. Utilizing Power BI, I'm designing a professional dashboard that showcases the geographical distribution of villages across different districts in Punjab. The dashboard provides insights into the distribution of villages by area and offers a name-wise tree structure for easy navigation. This project serves as a demonstration for my college assignment, ensuring fair use of data while giving proper credit. Join me in exploring the rich tapestry of Punjab's villages through this interactive dashboard!
